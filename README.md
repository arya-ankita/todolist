# todolist
It is a backend code for TODO List Application
This application is having two parts, Admin and User. For Authorization I used JWT token.
ADMIN - 
Admin can see the list of all users, present in the application.
Admin can also update the user information.
Admin can also delete a user.
USER - 
User can Register for the application.
After register for application user can login.
User can also reset the password.
For password reset I am using the nodemailer. User will get an email for password reset.
ToDo List - 
After login to the application, user can see the list of task.
Each task will have the status(start->progress->done).
User can add the task on ToDolist.
User can also delete the task from the ToDolist.
